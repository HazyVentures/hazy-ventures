        I came to hazy with 1000 bags of feed and said I wanted to do something exciting with it. Their A.I. told me to make A water park with it. Now I'm making 6 figures and turning a tidy profit. Plus all the corn I can eat.

        At my old company we had a constant problem with eavesdroppers stealing our idea before they came to market. I approached hazy with the Idea of make eavesdroppers a thing of the past. With hazys A.I. I was able to make the talking tube and accomplished my goals.
